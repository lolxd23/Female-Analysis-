This is a Behavioral Measurements and Body Fat in Females Aged 25–30 Analysis. I performed a thorough statistical analysis using R on a dataset of 20 girls in the 25–30 age range, analyzing the correlation between body fat percentage and three physical measurements: midarm circumference, thigh circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness.
